# Learn React

This is an app I will build following the Wes Bos course [ReactForBeginners.com](https://ReactForBeginners.com).

## Set-up

Open iTerm and change directory to the catch-of-the-day folder. The `package.json` file includes the dependencies and devDependencies required for the app.

Run this command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install all dependencies and devDependencies.

Run this command for the React dev server:

```bash
$ npm start
```
